# Git Challenges

This repository contains a series of challenges aimed at improving your understanding and proficiency with Git.
These tasks cover common scenarios you'll encounter when working with version control.
Below is a breakdown of the challenges,
along with a brief explanation and step-by-step instructions for each task.

## 1. Missing File Fix

### Problem
You forgot to add `test4.md` to the last commit. After running `git status` and `git log`, you realize this oversight.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Green Way@PAU MINGW64 ~/Git-exercises (main|REBASE)
$ git status
interactive rebase in progress; onto f1cfaf6
No commands done.
Next commands to do (2 remaining commands):
   pick f8a8700 chore: Create another file
   squash 026feb4 Create second file
  (use "git rebase --edit-todo" to view and edit)
You are currently editing a commit while rebasing branch 'main' on 'f1cfaf6'.
  (use "git commit --amend" to amend the current commit)
(use "git rebase --continue" once you are satisfied with your changes)
=======
### Challenge
Recover from this error by staging/adding `test4.md` and amending the commit message with an appropriate description.
>>>>>>> 8b65daf004ffbcf525fe8f10569991fee1268b48

### Steps
1. Run `git status` to verify the missing file.
2. Stage the file with `git add test4.md`.
3. Amend the last commit message using:
   ```bash
   git commit --amend
   ```
4. Modify the commit message to something descriptive and save.

## 2. Editing Commit History

### Problem
You need to maintain clear and accurate commit messages. The message "Create another file" is unclear and should be changed to "Create second file."

<<<<<<< HEAD
##Keeping History Tidy - Squashing Commits:
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

Squashing combines multiple commits into a single one. Let's merge "Create second file" into "Create initial file" for a cleaner history.
Challenge: Use interactive rebasing with the squash command to achieve this. learn more about squash here

### Challenge
Use interactive rebasing (`git rebase -i HEAD~2`) to edit the commit message and ensure clarity.
>>>>>>> 8b65daf004ffbcf525fe8f10569991fee1268b48

### Steps
1. Run:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~2
   ```
2. Change the word `pick` to `reword` next to the commit you want to modify.
3. Edit the commit message and save.

## 3. Keeping History Tidy - Squashing Commits

### Problem
Your history is cluttered with multiple commits that can be combined into one for a cleaner and more meaningful log.

### Challenge
Use interactive rebasing with the `squash` command to combine the commits "Create second file" and "Create initial file" into a single commit.

### Steps
1. Run:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~2
   ```
2. Change `pick` to `squash` (or `s` for short) for the second commit.
3. Combine the commit messages and save.

## 4. Splitting a Commit

### Problem
The commit message "Create third and fourth files" is too vague, and you want to split it into two commits with more precise messages.

### Challenge
Use `git reset` to separate the changes into two individual commits with distinct messages.

### Steps
1. Run:
   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   ```
2. Stage the files for the first commit:
   ```bash
   git add <file1>
   ```
3. Commit with a specific message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Create Third File"
   ```
4. Stage and commit the remaining changes for the second file:
   ```bash
   git add <file2>
   git commit -m "Create Fourth File"
   ```

## 5. Advanced Squashing

### Problem
You want to combine two commits into one, but this time, the commits contain more complex changes.

### Challenge
Use interactive rebasing to squash the last two commits ("Create third file" and "Create fourth file") into one commit with a new message: "Create third and fourth files."

### Steps
1. Run:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~2
   ```
2. Change `pick` to `squash` for the second commit.
3. Edit the combined commit message and save.

> Check step 4 for more on [advanced squashing](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History).

<<<<<<< HEAD
Splitting a Commit in Git
Sometimes, a commit message might describe too many changes at once, like "Create third and fourth files." Itâ€™s better to separate such commits for better tracking and clarity. In this guide, weâ€™ll learn how to split a commit using git reset and create individual commits with distinct messages.
<<<<<<< HEAD

Example Scenario:
You have a commit that says:

sql
Copy
Edit
Create third and fourth files
But you want to split this into two separate commits with different messages, such as:

"Create third file"
"Create fourth file"
Steps to Split the Commit
Check your commit history: Start by reviewing your recent commits with:

bash
Copy
Edit
git log
Example output:

sql
Copy
Edit

    chore: Create initial file
    chore: Create another file
    Create second file
Reset the commit (soft reset): Use the git reset command to unstage the changes in the last commit while keeping them in the working directory.

bash
Copy
Edit
git reset --soft HEAD~1
This command will move the HEAD to the previous commit and keep all changes staged.

Stage the first file and commit: Add the changes for the third file and commit it with an appropriate message.

bash
Copy
Edit
git add test3.md
git commit -m "Create third file"
Stage the second file and commit: Add the changes for the fourth file and commit it with a new message.

bash
Copy
Edit
git add test4.md
git commit -m "Create fourth file"
Check the commit history: After splitting the commit, check your commit log again to confirm that you have two separate commits:

bash
Copy
Edit
git log

## 6. Dropping a Commit

### Problem
You mistakenly created a commit with unwanted changes that you need to remove from your history.

### Challenge
Use `git rebase -i` to identify and remove the "Unwanted commit" from your history. Hereâ€™s how to proceed:

### Steps
1. Create a new file named `unwanted.txt` and commit it with the message "Unwanted commit":
   ```bash
   touch unwanted.txt
   git add unwanted.txt
   git commit -m "Unwanted commit"
   ```
2. Run:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~2
   ```
3. Change `pick` to `drop` for the unwanted commit.
4. Save and exit the rebase editor.
